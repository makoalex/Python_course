It's a concept that is separate from python but there is an implementation where we can write and use REGEX inn our code
Because it's not something python specific we have to work with the Rgex library
A REGULAR EXPRESSION  is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern
It's a powerful language for matching text patterns
In Python we can take the patterns that we define and test it, so it can take 2 or 3 lines to validate an email
instead of looping through or using if statements


Basic REGEX EXPRESSIONS
using PYTHEX
if you want to escape the meaning of a character we have to use backslash in front of the character that has special meaning
NB!! - it is case sensitive, so it will match only uppercase or lowercase
\d -- any digit
\w -- any letter, digit, or underscore
\s -- any whitespace or tab,  takes also the new line at the end of a row
\D -- everything that is a not a digit
\W --  mot a word character
\. -- any character except the line break
QUANTIFIERS
help to manipulate what we are looking for.
{2} with a number inside can help manipulate the amount of characters you want to select
ex: 929 2403-333      \d{3} \d{4}-\d{3} -- selection of numbers from a file
987 4721-211
+ means one or more after the selection
{1,2} means we can have a range of times something can occur
so for example, in order to have all the characters that are between 5 and 6 characters long we would have to write this
\s\w{5,6}\s using the range curly braces
{3,} using a number and a comma, means 3 or more in a row
* means zero or more times in a row
? means zero or once underlines something that is optional
987 4721-211
980 4567334
in the ex above, if we want to select the 1st we would write :\d{3} \d{4}-\d{3}
fir the second we would have to add the '?' because  the dash would be considered optional \d{3} \d{4}-?\d{3}

I. in order to select groups of characters or ranges we can use a [] and insert the group we are looking for
II.  if we want to match double or triple values wecan add a[]{2} and it will look for  double values
III. we have word delimiters like \b that select only the words in a given syntax like : \b\w\b
IV. and we have the carrot ^ which outside square brackets states the beginning of a statement, and the $ wich states
    the end .
V. we have the '|' which means OR. Ex: 415 216-3198  In order to select both numbers we have to navigate around the
                                      (415) 216-3198  parenthesis: (\(\d{3}\)|\d{3}) this will select only the first 3
                                                      digits with OR without parenthesis(all needs to be within a new
                                                      parenthesis so as to separate it from the rest of the code
VI. we can separate all the components with parenthesis like in this ex:
    Mr. Ola løvholm          - (Mr\.|Mrs\.|Ms\.) ([A-Za-z]+ [A-Za-zøØæÆå]+)-the first parant separates the mr., mrs., ms
    Ms. Alexandra Macovei      while the second one takes the first and last names
    Mrs. Ada Sværå           - It's a way of signifying that this content is a group

    In Python the results by doing this will come in two parts . If we want to separate them into 3 components instead
    of 2 we could just add a new parenthesis around the groups;
