 we will see how to write Python code that will match a string using REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
 define a function that returns true if it matches a pattern of false if it doesn't
 extract al matches from a given string and returns it in a list

We start by importing Re module in python which provides regular expressions matching operations
NB. MOST regular expressions operations are available as methods or module level functions on COMPILED REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
A REGULAR EXPRESSION RE specifies a set of strings that matches it.
the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a regular expression

in the re module, after compilein our regex expression we can do a search in our stings to get a match
we can use SEARCH which will return one result
we can use FINDALL which will return all non-overlapping matches

as a side note, we don't always have to compile before we search
there is a distinction between 1.re.search(pattern, string, flags=0)
                               2. Pattern.search(string[, pos[, endpos]])
with the first example --re.search(r'\d{3} \d{4}-\d{3}', ' call me at this number 987 4721-211')-- we have to recompile
                       every time we do the search
with the second example --re.compile(r'\d{3} \d{4}-\d{3}')
                        --  pattern.search(' call me at this number 987 4721-211')
                        --print(res.group())
            we only have to compile it once  as a  regular expression object and it can be reused
