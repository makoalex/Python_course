Python has a built in Sqlite library that comes with it
SQlite  is a c library that provides lightweight disk- based database that doesn't require a separate server process
I. to use the module, we firs have to make a connection object that represents the database here the data will be stored in the
example.db database
II. once we have the connection we have to create a cursor object, which is like a work area for sql commands
    -it allocates this little bit of memory for us to work an it will return some data.
    -basically we crate a cursor and execute different lines of SQL with it
III.  we use the cursor to execute some code with it and then we commit the changes
           connection = sqlite3.connect('name of the databse.db')
           c= connection.cursor()
           we use that cursor for example to create a table: c.execute(CREATE TABLE name of table...);
           the we commit the changes : connection.commit()
           and close the connection: connection.close()
IV. when we create a new insert we can either got the SQl way:
               insert_query= "INSERT INTO name of table(NAME1 text etc.) VALUES( fill the values)"
            then we execute the changes: c.execute(insert_query)
            then commit: connection.commit()
V. we don't want to insert random data , variables into the code manually
    when we have data coming in from forms or applications we have to process it,
VI. the way we add things to a data base is with the use of "?" for every value that needs to be added in
    - we then execute that, but also add a tuple containing all the values that we want added in.
    - the tuple is necessary, otherwise the code will iterate over each character of the strings or values we pass in
