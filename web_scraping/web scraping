Web scraping helps with getting a lot of data from websites, without us having to do it manually
we can extract the date, parse it and use it
we can use web scraping if there is no other way to do it like an API, and we need the data to analyze or ti store

BEAUTIFUL SOUP
allows us to extract HTML data using Python,
it does not download HTMl for us. we will have to use the request module
we have to manually make the request to scrape the date

use the request module to send a GET request, use the HTMl data we get back and send it to beautiful soup, and the we extract the INFO

we have to call Beautiful Soup after we import it

BeautifulSoup(html_string, "html.parser")-parse html

important to remember that HTML always comes back as a string
after that we can navigate through it using either -tag names:h1, h2, p, a
                                                   - use a method called FIND with will return a matching tag
                                                   -use a method called FIND_ALL witch will return a list of matching tags
when we parse, the representation that is printed looks like HTML but is an instance of BS and has a bunch of methods that we can use
whenever we call these methods, they may look like strings but they are <bs4.element. tag>, BS turn each tag into its own individual object.
the big parsing being like a class
when working with BS, and use the find_all method, in the case of classes you must use an underscore after, otherwise Python will think that you are declaring a class
